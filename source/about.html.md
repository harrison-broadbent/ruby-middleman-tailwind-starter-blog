# About this template (and the author)

![Profile picture of the author (me!)](https://harrisonbroadbent.com/images/profile.jpg){:class="w-36"}_↑ That's me! ↑_

Hey, my name's Harrison, and I'm the author of this template. I've used [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) for years to build my [personal site](https://harrisonbroadbent.com/about), and I figured it was time I shared what I've learned.

Is Middleman dying? [Probably.](https://github.com/middleman/middleman/tags) Is it a good choice for your personal site / blog? Maybe? Do I love it as a lightweight framework for building a simple static site and a lightweight blog? Absolutely.

I work with Ruby on Rails quite often, and it's always refreshing to come back to a piece of software like Middleman, where the surface area is so much smaller.

I've tried to include things that I think you'll find really handy in this template — TailwindCSS, a blog system pre-configured, handy CSS hacks I've learned, code highlighting and more.

I hope you find it useful!
